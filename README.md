Trajectories of tetranucleotides
================================

This repository contains molecular dynamics trajectories for 5 RNA tetranucleotides (AAAA, CAAU, CCCC, GACC, and UUUU).

Trajectories were obtained using T-REMD simulations. Full description can be found in [Bottaro et al, 2016](http:dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw239).
Only snapshots from the reference replica are included here.
In case you find these trajectories useful, please cite the orginal paper.
