Trajectories of tetranucleotides
================================

This repository contains molecular dynamics trajectories for 5 RNA tetranucleotides (AAAA, CAAU, CCCC, GACC, and UUUU).

Trajectories were obtained using T-REMD simulations. Full description can be found in [Bottaro et al, 2016](http:dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw239).
Only snapshots from the replica at 300K are included here. In the setup folder you can find A-form reference pdb files, as well as the mpd file for the production run.
In case you find these trajectories useful, please cite the orginal paper.
BibTex citation can be found [here](./reference.bib).
